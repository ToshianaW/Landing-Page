# landing-page
I'm creating my first landing page! This is my first major project from the Odin Project
where I take what I have learned from both the HTML and CSS lessons and apply it to my landing page. 
This landing page was inspired by my puppy, a rescue german shepherd who has been there for me as my closest friend.
